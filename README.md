## FAQ

### What does this do?

This texture mosaics implementation tries to hide texture tiling. Typically when you tile a texture more than a couple of times, you'll be able to see a clear pattern in the texture.

Here is a before/after:

### What kind of textures does this work for?

This shader works great with any texture that doesn't really have a pattern to it. This shader should even work with textures that aren't seamless.

This shader will not work well with anything that has a pattern to it like tiles, panels, bricks, etc.
